# SimpleMIDIController
In this project I constructed a simple MIDI controller using the piezo element, a
potentiometer, and a capacitive touch sensor. The MIDI controller allows the user
to play notes and change the frequency of notes on the fly! The project uses two
inputs, the touch sensor will be using the I2C communication protocol and the dial
will be using an ADC(Protocol that converts analog signals to digital signals on
the ATmega board) to set the proper frequency for the sound. Finally, the piezo
element will serves as an output by outputting sound. I wanted to design this project
because I want to play some sick beats!
